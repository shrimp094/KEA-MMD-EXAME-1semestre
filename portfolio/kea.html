        <h1>Basic web helped me as a web designer to learn how to structure a projectc, to analyse and debate design principles as also to work with color, typografy and diferent design factors. Some of the requirements for this theme where learning how to use XD to prototype my projects, know how to use user tests so that my work is well defended and to understand and produce responsive web design. For this theme I present the project group that consisted in transforming an old website in to a new and better one. (link's below the image)</h1>

In the prosses i also learned the importance of storytelling, style tiles and sequence diagrams. I did several works for this theme, this is 'The Void' a project that i had started a few years ago but never had the courage to animate it, it consistes in several files that explain the intere process being the interactive animation the final project.

        <h1>For the last project we had a group assignment. The theme was a movie called 'Some like it hot' and we needed to grab the movie environment and create an interactive teaser to present it to a school. For this we had to apply every thing we had learned until now. Design was very important because we had to stablish some rules so that everything stayed precise. For me this assignment, the most important aspect was the group work, learn to devide and keep up with others so that the project could evolve. (links below the image)

It was a group work that lasted one month what dificulted even more the distribution of the work to be done. One of the points of this project was to create the identity of a company from it's meaning to it's public aproach, passing for several steps explained in the design program and report.

        The assignment required that we build a frontpage for a fictional company that needed a presentation video about CityWalk and Meet Ups.
        We tried to created a diferent and in my point of view very interesting concept to do it. We filmed everything from a feet prespetive giving meaning and visual content so that the user could see it self on it.(links below the image)
